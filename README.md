# ZGDetector
To detect the input string is Zawgyi text or not
This is result of a code_diving from http://unicode.org/cldr/trac/browser/trunk/tools/java/org/unicode/cldr/util/MyanmarZawgyiConverter.java. Original code will detect Myanmar Ethnic's language (Shan, Mon, Karen and so on) as Zawgyi Text. Nightly, it will pretty good on detecting Zawgyi text with more than 20 patterns. Some parts are modified.
